# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio website that highlights some information about me and some interesting projects I've been making while pursuing my studies at Mohawk College.

The website follows the principle of "Simplicity is the Beauty" (as with most of my projects), therefore, the whole website is designed using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Intentionally not using any frameworks.
